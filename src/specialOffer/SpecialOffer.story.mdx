## Specifications

This component should be use to represent one Special Offer (also called a Good
Deal).

Note that there is two variants: you can use link or button actions (0, 1 or 2)

## Usage

```jsx
import { SpecialOffer } from '@blablacar/ui-library/build/specialOffer'
```

To create a SpecialOffer without any CTAs:

```jsx
<SpecialOffer
  picture={{
    url: "https://cdn.blablacar.com/kairos/assets/build/images/blablasure_logo-459e4b952a6cc04b72ea0e12f98ec673.svg",
    alt: "The BlaBlaSur offer logo",
  }}
  title="A wonderful offer"
  description="Once you receive your first rating, receive a 30€ voucher on Total spring green electricity offer for your home. So come back here to enjoy it !"
/>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="no CTAs">
    <SpecialOffer
      picture={{
        url: 'https://cdn.blablacar.com/kairos/assets/build/images/blablasure_logo-459e4b952a6cc04b72ea0e12f98ec673.svg',
        alt: 'The BlaBlaSur offer logo',
      }}
      title="A wonderful offer"
      description="Once you receive your first rating, receive a 30€ voucher on Total spring green electricity offer for your home. So come back here to enjoy it !"
      actions={[]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

To create a SpecialOffer with links as CTAs, pass links properties to the `actions` props (1 or 2 links)

```jsx
<SpecialOffer
  picture={{
    url: "https://cdn.blablacar.com/kairos/assets/build/images/blablasure_logo-459e4b952a6cc04b72ea0e12f98ec673.svg",
    alt: "The BlaBlaSur offer logo",
  }}
  title="A wonderful offer"
  description="Once you receive your first rating, receive a 30€ voucher on Total spring green electricity offer for your home. So come back here to enjoy it !"
  actions={[
    {
      label: "Register for option 1!",
      url: "http://example.com/register1",
    },
  ]}
/>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="links as CTAs">
    <SpecialOffer
      picture={{
        url: 'https://cdn.blablacar.com/kairos/assets/build/images/blablasure_logo-459e4b952a6cc04b72ea0e12f98ec673.svg',
        alt: 'The BlaBlaSur offer logo',
      }}
      title="A wonderful offer"
      description="Once you receive your first rating, receive a 30€ voucher on Total spring green electricity offer for your home. So come back here to enjoy it !"
      actions={[
        {
          label: 'Register for option 1!',
          url: 'http://example.com/register1',
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

To create a SpecialOffer with buttons as CTAs, pass buttons properties to `actions` props (1 or 2 buttons)

```jsx
<SpecialOffer
  picture={{
    url: "https://cdn.blablacar.com/kairos/assets/build/images/blablasure_logo-459e4b952a6cc04b72ea0e12f98ec673.svg",
    alt: "The BlaBlaSur offer logo",
  }}
  title="A wonderful offer"
  description="Once you receive your first rating, receive a 30€ voucher on Total spring green electricity offer for your home. So come back here to enjoy it !"
  actions={[
    {
      label: "Click for option 1!",
      onClick: action('clicked 1'),
    },
    {
      label: "Click for option 2!",
      onClick: action('clicked 2'),
    },
  ]}
/>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="buttons as CTAs">
    <SpecialOffer
      picture={{
        url: 'https://cdn.blablacar.com/kairos/assets/build/images/blablasure_logo-459e4b952a6cc04b72ea0e12f98ec673.svg',
        alt: 'The BlaBlaSur offer logo',
      }}
      title="A wonderful offer"
      description="Once you receive your first rating, receive a 30€ voucher on Total spring green electricity offer for your home. So come back here to enjoy it !"
      actions={[
        {
          label: 'Click for option 1!',
          onClick: action('clicked 1'),
        },
        {
          label: 'Click for option 2!',
          onClick: action('clicked 2'),
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
